# [Candroid](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Candroid/) Photo Viewer

`Candroid Photo Viewer is the default image viewer for Candroid. It supports all the image formats Android does, except it supports NetP instead of WebP.`

## Install

The project is currently in the Alpha stage of development, and is not yet functional.

## Supported formats

Candroid Photo Viewer supports all the image formats that Android supports by default, with one exception (NetP instead of WebP)

* `*.png`
* `*.pns`
* `*.jpg`
* `*.jpeg`
* `*.jfif`
* `*.gif`
* `*.heif`
* `*.netp` (supported over WebP for ethical reasons)
